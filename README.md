# NotIntersectingLinesGraph
> The not intersecting lines graph tries to place a random line
on a board with given lines. The line is tested against all
other lines in the graph. If it's valid it gets added to the graph. 
After a specified number of attempts the graph eventually ends and
saves a jpg image in the output folder.

A graphical exploration written in the language of processing.
